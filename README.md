By the Caverns of Thracia! That’s entirely up to the DM and players, because no two groups are the same. One group might like a sandbox while another wants a grand epic tale, and those two tales simply don’t combine well. (No, they don’t. Either you pick one, or you regularly switch between the two, but you cannot combine them.) Some parties like political intrigue and worldbuilding, others just want a weekly campaign where they don’t need to remember things that they heard a month ago.
